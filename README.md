# Readme for zero_day repository
The repo simply contains a directory **0x00-vagrant** to contain the task at hand and also this readme to explain its content and reason for doing the project.

# Vagrant - or - how to code in your local computer
I am attempting to push my first repository using a local virtual machine instead of the usual sandbox

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/g5OVhHRsT0jjsvUI1Y8jgw), without the help of Google:
- What is a virtual machine
- What is Vagrant
- Who wrote Vagrant
- What is Ubuntu
- What does “Ubuntu” mean
- How to use VMs with Vagrant
- What does the command uname do
